# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In, First Out (LIFO), that is, the last element pushed onto the stack is removed first.

## Basic Operations

The basic operations of stack are:

- `push`: Add an element to the top of a stack
- `pop`: Remove an element from the top of a stack
- `peek`: Get the top element's value without removing it
- `is_empty`: Check if the stack is empty
- `is_full`: Check if the stack is full

## Implementation

- Fixed-Size Array Stack
- Dynamic Array Stack
- Linked List Stack

## Time & Space Complexity

For the array-based implementation of a stack, the push and pop operations take constant time, i.e., $O(1)$.

## Applications

- Reverse String
- Parentheses Matching
- Function Call Management
- Expression Evaluation
- Undo Mechanisms
- Browser History (backward and forward navigation)
- Memory Management
- Algorithm Implementations (depth-first search (DFS), backtracking, parsing, etc.)
- Expression Conversion
- Task Scheduling
- Parsing XML/HTML
